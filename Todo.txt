IPV4 header

option 
	allow user to define colors in a file that is passed as argument to hdr
		when Text::Colorized is used
		
in direct dump mode, use the offset passed by the user to set the starting offset point
	000017 xx xx xx xx                    something starting at offset 17

Data::hexDump::Table
	see IPV4 example on wikipedia

Test::Hexdump::Range
	alway use ANSI or ascii. or direct to file and accept any format
	not user settable color (we cycle)
	different bytes are displayed with red background
		how do we tell DHR to change the color of only a few bytes within a range
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_got,10,on_red:data,80:footer,16'
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_exp,10,black on_green:data,80:footer,16'

	cyclic colors must contain OK and error colors
	user settable number of ranges to dispay after and before the diff in the binary data
	side by side comparizon in vertical mode
