?? unpack("B*",  $_[0]->{DATA}) ; shouldn't we use b* when bit 0 is on the right

sync with random color index from a range color definition

let range modify display options on the fly
	displaying a lot of data , width 32 otherwise 4

update hdr_user_documentation
	make the already gathered ranges available to $range_provider 
		dynamic ipv4 header
	dynamic comment range example
		show example or error message and the usage of -d to see when things go wrong

refactoring
	do not cary the data in the ranges
	type instead for IS_COMMENT, IS_BITFIELD, IS_SKIP
	split should use $self->{FIELD_LENGTH}
	author tests
	spelling
	skip range code
	bitfield column display code
		cleaner
		more effective
	data flow and architectural overview
