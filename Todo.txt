in hor + display_bitfields, all bf have the same color?! white
options to not show comment ranges (except zero size option)

make the already gathered ranges available to $range_provider 
	show example
	
dynamic comment range example
	show example or error message and the usage of -d to see when things go wrong
	
user info max width options



refactoring
	do not cary the data in the ranges
	type instead for IS_COMMENT, IS_BITFIELD, IS_SKIP
	split should use $self->{FIELD_LENGTH}
	author tests
	spelling
	skip range code
	bitfield column display code
		cleaner
		more effective

# 			display extra info about the bit fields(done through a
# 			range sub) (this could also be done for any range)
